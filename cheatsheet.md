This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT


when the user first runs the program they are able to choose between adding their own plan (activity) or getting a recommendation. if they add their own, the enter the activity, place (stay in/go out), type(relax/active), and budget. if they choose to get a recommendation, they enter place, type, and budget and get an randomly generated activity that matches their inputs. when they enter their plan or get the recommendation, they are asked if they want to continue or end. if they continue, they will once again be asked if they want to enter a plan or get a recommendation and will follow the steps again until they end, in which the program finishes.
